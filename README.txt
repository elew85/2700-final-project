CSPB 2270 Final Project - Fall 2024

// REQUIREMENTS:
project data structure implemented
short explanation of the data structure
If your project is something I can run, please give instructions on how to do that
If your project isn't something that I can run, show me what it does. You can take a video and upload it to YouTube or Vimeo or simply to a private Google drive link. Or if video isn't your thing, a document with screenshots and words explaining what's going on.
The main goal is to communicate clearly what you did and why.
